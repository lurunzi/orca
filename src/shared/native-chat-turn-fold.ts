// Which rows a settled turn folds behind its "Worked for N" status row.
//
// A turn's answer is its last assistant row that renders prose, or its last
// failure report; everything before it is the work that produced it. The journal
// carries no "this one is the answer" marker on a message, so the answer is
// derived rather than read — last candidate wins. So a failed turn ends on its
// error, and an error the agent recovered from folds behind the answer after it.
//
// A hidden delivery (another session's message, a task notification) splits a
// turn into replies, and each reply keeps its own answer, so a later reply never
// folds an earlier one away.
//
// Shared because desktop and mobile both draw this disclosure, and a fold that
// hides a different row on each surface is the same bug twice.
